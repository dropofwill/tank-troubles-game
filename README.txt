Tank Trouble is a top down shooter game. In the levels the goal is to retrieve the star without getting shot by the pesky daleks. In time trial mode the goal is to shoot as many targets as possible in 20 seconds. Bounce the bullet off the walls to earn extra points. The bullets can bounce off the walls twice before exploding, but can only kill one object each.
